Self-Introduction
===========

I am a science and engineering major Ph.D., specializing in laboratory and field works. I started to practically program when I needed to use Matlab and SAS for data analysis of large data sets. I have taken classes of C and Fortran programming languages in college as a beginner in programming and have done excellent jobs. So, I am able to get started with any popuplar languages by myself. I am comfortable with Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. After many years of work as an engineer, I found myself more interested in tasks involving more programming. I guess the reason lies in the challenge of programming itself, as well as the potential to increase efficiency by programming. I would like to develop my career with a focus on programming rather than just playing with Excel.

Currently, the programming lanugages which I can use to program include C/C++, Fortran, Java, Python, HTML, PHP, XML, JavaScript. In terms of data management and analysis, I am very good at SQL, familiar with MS SQL, MySQL, and oracle SQL. Software I have used in data analysis include Matlab/Octave, SAS, R, SPSS, JMP, Tabeau, HP Vertica, and MS Excel. I am willing to incorporate all those skills and become extremely productive.
